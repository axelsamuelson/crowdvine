2. **Basic** (0-4 IP) → Entry level, 2 invites/month
3. **Brons** (5-14 IP) → Active member, 5 invites/month, fee reduction
4. **Silver** (15-34 IP) → Trusted, 12 invites/month, early access
5. **Guld** (≥35 IP) → Top tier, 50 invites/month, exclusive drops

Plus **Admin** level (manual assignment) for platform operators.
