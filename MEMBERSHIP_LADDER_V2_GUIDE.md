# üéØ PACT Membership Ladder v2 - Complete System Guide

## Overview

PACT Membership Ladder v2 is an advanced progression system that builds upon the existing membership framework. It introduces **progression rewards**, **temporary buffs**, **extended IP events**, and **enhanced UX** to create a FIFA/Amex-inspired premium experience.

**Key Philosophy:** Reward consistent engagement through temporary micro-bonuses that expire on use or level-up, encouraging continuous progression without long-term margin erosion.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Database Tables

#### New Tables (Migration 042)

**1. `user_progression_buffs`**
Stores temporary percentage discounts earned during level progression.

```sql
- id: UUID (primary key)
- user_id: UUID (references auth.users)
- buff_percentage: DECIMAL(5,2) - e.g., 0.5 for 0.5%
- buff_description: TEXT
- earned_at: TIMESTAMPTZ
- expires_on_use: BOOLEAN (default TRUE)
- used_at: TIMESTAMPTZ (NULL if not used)
- level_segment: VARCHAR(20) - 'basic-bronze', 'bronze-silver', 'silver-gold'
- related_ip_event_id: UUID (references impact_point_events)
```

**2. `progression_rewards`**
Configurable reward definitions per level segment and IP threshold.

```sql
- id: UUID (primary key)
- level_segment: VARCHAR(20) - which segment this reward belongs to
- ip_threshold: INTEGER - exact IP value to trigger reward
- reward_type: VARCHAR(50) - buff_percentage, badge, early_access_token, fee_waiver, celebration
- reward_value: TEXT - value for the reward
- reward_description: TEXT
- is_active: BOOLEAN
- sort_order: INTEGER
```

### TypeScript Modules

**1. `lib/membership/points-engine.ts`**
Core IP awarding logic (extended in v2).

**2. `lib/membership/progression-rewards.ts` (NEW)**
Handles progression buff lifecycle:

- Awarding buffs at IP milestones
- Fetching active buffs
- Calculating total buff percentage
- Applying buffs to orders
- Clearing buffs on level-up

**3. UI Components:**

- `components/membership/progression-buff-display.tsx` - Full and compact buff displays
- `components/membership/gold-celebration.tsx` - Confetti celebration for Gold unlock
- Enhanced `LevelProgress` and `IPTimeline` components

## üíé Progression Rewards System

### Concept

As users earn IP within a level segment (e.g., Basic‚ÜíBronze), they unlock **temporary micro-rewards** that provide immediate value without permanent discounts.

### Reward Types

1. **Buff Percentage** (`buff_percentage`)
   - Temporary discount on next order
   - Stacks within segment (up to max)
   - Expires on use or level-up
   - Example: +0.5% at 2 IP, +0.5% at 4 IP = 1% total

2. **Badge** (`badge`)
   - Unlockable achievement
   - Displayed in user profile
   - Permanent (doesn't expire)

3. **Early Access Token** (`early_access_token`)
   - One-time early access to a wine drop
   - Consumed when used
   - Premium benefit

4. **Fee Waiver** (`fee_waiver`)
   - One-time service fee waived
   - Applied to next order
   - Immediate value

5. **Celebration** (`celebration`)
   - Special UI event (e.g., confetti)
   - Marks major milestones (like Gold unlock)

### Default Progression Rewards

#### Basic ‚Üí Bronze (0-4 IP)

| IP  | Reward Type | Value         | Description                               |
| --- | ----------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 2   | Buff %      | 0.5%          | Progress bonus: +0.5% on next reservation |
| 4   | Buff %      | 0.5%          | Progress bonus: +0.5% on next reservation |
| 4   | Badge       | pact_initiate | Unlock: PACT Initiate badge               |

**Max possible buff:** 1% (0.5% + 0.5%)

#### Bronze ‚Üí Silver (5-14 IP)

| IP  | Reward Type        | Value | Description                        |
| --- | ------------------ | ----- | ---------------------------------- |
| 10  | Early Access Token | 1     | Early Drop Access Token (one-time) |
| 14  | Fee Waiver         | 1     | Free service fee (one-time)        |

**No buff stacking** - focused on access perks

#### Silver ‚Üí Gold (15-34 IP)

| IP  | Reward Type | Value            | Description                             |
| --- | ----------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 20  | Buff %      | 1.0%             | Progress bonus: +1% on next reservation |
| 25  | Buff %      | 1.0%             | Progress bonus: +1% on next reservation |
| 30  | Buff %      | 1.0%             | Progress bonus: +1% on next reservation |
| 30  | Badge       | silver_collector | Unlock: Silver Collector Pack           |
| 35  | Celebration | gold_unlock      | Gold level unlocked! üéâ                 |

**Max possible buff:** 3% (1% + 1% + 1%)

### Buff Lifecycle

```
1. User earns IP (e.g., reaches 2 IP in Basic level)
   ‚Üì
2. System checks progression_rewards table for rewards at IP=2 in segment 'basic-bronze'
   ‚Üì
3. If buff_percentage reward found ‚Üí create entry in user_progression_buffs
   ‚Üì
4. Buff displays in profile and checkout with amber styling
   ‚Üì
5. User places order ‚Üí buff applied to discount calculation
   ‚Üì
6. System marks buff as used (used_at = NOW())
   ‚Üì
7. Buff no longer appears in active buffs

OR

User levels up ‚Üí all buffs cleared automatically (clear_progression_buffs_on_level_up)
```

---

## üîÑ Integration Points

### Order Completion (`app/api/checkout/confirm/route.ts`)

When an order is placed:

1. **Apply progression buffs** ‚Üí Mark as used
2. **Award IP for order** ‚Üí Based on bottle count
3. **Check invited user's 2nd order** ‚Üí Award inviter if applicable
4. **Check pallet milestones** ‚Üí Award milestone IP
5. **Award progression rewards** ‚Üí Check for new buffs at new IP total

All steps logged extensively for debugging.

### Profile Page (`app/profile/page.tsx`)

Displays:

- Active progression buffs with full breakdown
- Enhanced LevelProgress showing buff indicator
- Gold celebration modal when unlocked
- Real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions

### Checkout Page (`app/checkout/page.tsx`)

Shows:

- Prominent ProgressionBuffDisplay at top
- Buff discount line in order summary (amber color)
- Automatic application (no manual selection)
- "Expires on use" messaging

### Admin Panel (`app/admin/memberships/page.tsx`)

Two tabs:

1. **Membership Levels** - Existing perk management
2. **Progression Rewards** - View all progression rewards by segment

---

## üé® UI/UX Enhancements

### FIFA-Style Progress Bar

- **Thicker bar** (h-3 instead of h-2)
- **Enhanced shimmer effect** with inner glow
- **Percentage display** next to current IP
- **Active buff indicator** below progress bar

### Event Timeline

New icons and colors for v2 events:

- `invite_second_order` ‚Üí ShoppingCart (emerald)
- `own_order_large` ‚Üí ShoppingCart (indigo)
- `pallet_milestone_6` ‚Üí Package (amber)
- `pallet_milestone_12` ‚Üí Package (rose)
- `review_submitted` ‚Üí Star (cyan)
- `share_action` ‚Üí Share2 (pink)

### Amex-Inspired Premium Design

- **Metallic badges** with shimmer effects
- **Dark, sophisticated color palette**
- **Micro-animations** on buff awards
- **Confetti celebration** for Gold unlock
- **Subtle gradients** and shadows
- **Clear hierarchy** and spacing

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Admin Controls

### Invite with Initial Level

**Who can set level:**

- **Non-admins:** Can only create Basic invites
- **Admins:** Can choose Basic, Bronze, Silver, or Gold

**How it works:**

1. Admin selects level from dropdown in profile
2. Generates invite with `initial_level` set
3. When invite redeemed, user starts at chosen level
4. User still progresses normally via IP from that point

**Transparency:**
User's profile shows "Started at Silver via invite" for audit trail.

### Progression Rewards Configuration

**View all rewards:**

- Organized by level segment
- Color-coded by reward type
- Shows IP thresholds and descriptions
- Active/inactive status

**Future enhancements:**

- Edit reward values
- Add new custom rewards
- Enable/disable specific rewards
- Adjust IP thresholds

---

## üîí Anti-Gaming Measures

### Rate Limiting

**Reviews & Shares:**

- Max 1 IP per event type per 24 hours
- Checked via `impact_point_events` table
- Returns `rateLimited: true` if within window

**Implementation:**

```typescript
const recentEvent = await sb
  .from("impact_point_events")
  .select("id, created_at")
  .eq("user_id", userId)
  .eq("event_type", "review_submitted")
  .gte("created_at", new Date(Date.now() - 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000).toISOString())
  .single();

if (recentEvent) {
  return { rateLimited: true };
}
```

### Duplicate Prevention

**Invite Second Order:**

- Only awarded once per invited user
- Checks for existing event with same `related_user_id`

**Pallet Milestones:**

- Each milestone (3, 6, 12) awarded only once
- Uses specific event types to track

**Own Order:**

- Awards higher of the two (+1 for ‚â•6 or +2 for ‚â•12)
- Not both

---

## üìä Database Functions

### Helper Functions (Migration 042)

**1. `get_active_progression_buffs(user_id)`**
Returns all unused buffs for a user.

**2. `calculate_total_buff_percentage(user_id)`**
Sums all active buff percentages.

**3. `apply_progression_buffs(user_id, order_id)`**
Marks all active buffs as used.

**4. `clear_progression_buffs_on_level_up(user_id)`**
Clears all buffs when user levels up.

**5. `get_progression_rewards_for_segment(level_segment)`**
Gets all active rewards for a segment.

### Updated Functions (Migration 043)

**`check_and_upgrade_level(user_id)` (Enhanced)**
Now calls `clear_progression_buffs_on_level_up()` when level changes.

```sql
IF new_level != current_membership.level THEN
  -- Update level and quota
  UPDATE user_memberships SET level = new_level, ...

  -- Log upgrade
  INSERT INTO impact_point_events ...

  -- Clear progression buffs (NEW in v2)
  PERFORM clear_progression_buffs_on_level_up(p_user_id);
END IF;
```

import { awardPointsForOwnOrder } from "@/lib/membership/points-engine";

const bottleCount = 14;
const result = await awardPointsForOwnOrder(userId, bottleCount, orderId);

if (result.success) {
  console.log(`Awarded IP. New total: ${result.newTotal}`);
  // Result: +2 IP because bottleCount ‚â• 12
}
```

import { applyProgressionBuffs } from "@/lib/membership/progression-rewards";

const result = await applyProgressionBuffs(userId, orderId);

console.log(`Applied ${result.buffCount} buffs`);
console.log(`Total discount: ${result.appliedPercentage}%`);
// Buffs now marked as used in database
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Buffs Not Showing

**Check:**

1. Has user earned IP in current segment?
2. Are there progression_rewards configured at that IP?
3. Check `user_progression_buffs` table for entries
4. Verify `used_at IS NULL`

**Debug:**

```sql
-- Check active buffs
SELECT * FROM user_progression_buffs
WHERE user_id = 'user-id' AND used_at IS NULL;

-- Check rewards config
SELECT * FROM progression_rewards
WHERE is_active = TRUE
ORDER BY level_segment, ip_threshold;
```

### Buffs Not Clearing on Level-Up

**Check:**

1. Migration 043 applied?
2. `check_and_upgrade_level()` function updated?
3. Check Supabase logs for function execution

**Verify:**

```sql
-- Check function definition
SELECT routine_definition
FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_name = 'check_and_upgrade_level';
```

### IP Not Awarded

**Check:**

1. Order has enough bottles (‚â•6)?
2. Event type matches expected?
3. Rate limit for reviews/shares?
4. Check `impact_point_events` table

**Debug:**

```sql
-- Check recent IP events
SELECT * FROM impact_point_events
WHERE user_id = 'user-id'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
