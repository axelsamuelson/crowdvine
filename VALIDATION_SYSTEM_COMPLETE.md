# ✅ 6-Bottle Validation System - Complete

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive 6-bottle per producer checkout validation system with producer grouping functionality.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (Migration 047)

**Tables Created:**

- `producer_groups` - Groups of linked producers (e.g., "Languedoc Partners")
- `producer_group_members` - Many-to-many relationship between groups and producers

**Features:**

- RLS policies (public read, admin-only write)
- Helper function: `get_grouped_producers(producer_id)`
- Cascade delete (removing group removes all members)

**To Run:**

```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
-- Copy and run: migrations/047_producer_groups.sql
```

---

### 2. Validation Logic

**File:** `lib/checkout-validation.ts`

**How It Works:**

1. Looks up wines in database to get producer_id
2. Fetches producer groups from database
3. Groups cart items by producer or group
4. Validates each group has bottles in multiples of 6
5. Returns detailed validation results

**Smart Grouping:**

- Single producer: All wines from that producer count together
- Producer group: All wines from all producers in group count together
- Example: 3 bottles Producer A + 3 bottles Producer B (both in group) = 6 total ✅

---

### 3. Cart Sidebar Validation

**File:** `components/cart/cart-validation-display.tsx`

**Design:**

```
⚠️ 1 producer needs more bottles [˅]
   ↓ expand
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ ⚠️ Mas des Mesures  2   │ ← Clickable
│    + Add 4 more         │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**Features:**

- Collapsible (minimalist)
- Compact summary bar
- Expandable details
- Whole box clickable → Goes to producer/group page
- Smart links (producer or group depending on context)

---

### 4. Checkout Page Validation

**File:** `app/checkout/page.tsx`

**Invalid State:**

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ⚠️ Order Blocked                  (RED) │
│    Add bottles to meet 6-bottle          │
│    requirement                            │
├──────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                          │
│ Mas des Mesures                          │
│ Current: 2 bottles • Need 4 more for 6   │
│ Browse wines from this producer →        │
│                                          │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Valid State:**

```
┌──────────────────────────┐
│   [Place Reservation]    │
└──────────────────────────┘
```

**Features:**

- Clear "Order Blocked" header in red
- Shows exact problem per producer
- Action button/link to browse wines
- Button appears when valid
- No confusing states

---

### 5. Server-Side Validation

**File:** `app/api/checkout/confirm/route.ts`

**Security:**

- Final validation before creating order
- Returns 400 error if rule violated
- Prevents invalid orders even if client validation bypassed

**File:** `app/api/cart/validate/route.ts`

**API Endpoint:**

- GET /api/cart/validate
- Returns validation results
- Used by cart and checkout

---

### 6. Admin UI - Producer Groups

**File:** `app/admin/producer-groups/page.tsx`

**Features:**

- Create new producer groups
- Add/remove producers from groups
- Delete groups
- Visual display of all groups
- Info card explaining the 6-bottle rule

**Navigation:**

- Button on `/admin/producers` page
- "Producer Groups" outline button

**API Routes:**

- GET/POST `/api/admin/producer-groups`
- DELETE `/api/admin/producer-groups/[id]`
- POST `/api/admin/producer-groups/members`
- DELETE `/api/admin/producer-groups/members/[id]`

---

### 7. Producer Group Collection Pages

**File:** `app/shop/group/[groupId]/page.tsx`

**Shows:**

- All wines from ALL producers in the group
- Group name and description
- List of producers in group
- Standard product grid layout

**Example URL:**

- `/shop/group/abc-123-uuid`

**API:** `GET /api/shop/group/[groupId]/products`

---

## User Experience Flow

### Scenario: Customer adds 4 bottles

**1. In Cart:**

```
⚠️ 1 producer needs more bottles [˅]
```

- Compact, not intrusive
- Click to expand for details

**2. Expand Cart Validation:**

```
⚠️ Mas des Mesures  4
   + Add 2 more
```

- Click whole box → Go to `/shop/mas-des-mesures`

**3. At Checkout:**

```
⚠️ Order Blocked (RED - very clear)
Add bottles to meet 6-bottle requirement

┌──────────────────────────────┐
│ Mas des Mesures              │
│ Current: 4 • Need 2 more     │
│ Browse wines from... →       │
└──────────────────────────────┘
```

- Cannot submit (button replaced with warning)
- Click card → Go to producer page

**4. Add 2 More Bottles:**

- Use cart sidebar (always works)
- Or browse on producer page

**5. Return to Checkout:**

- Validation re-runs automatically
- Warning disappears
- Button appears: `[Place Reservation]`
- Can complete order!

---

## With Producer Groups

**Admin Setup:**

1. Go to `/admin/producer-groups`
2. Create "Languedoc Partners" group
3. Add Producer A and Producer B

**Customer Experience:**

```
Cart:
- 3 bottles Producer A
- 3 bottles Producer B
Total: 6 bottles in "Languedoc Partners" group ✅

Validation:
✅ Languedoc Partners  6
   ✓ Ready

Checkout:
[Place Reservation] ← Button works!
```

**Click validation in cart:**
→ Goes to `/shop/group/[groupId]`
→ Sees wines from both Producer A and B
→ Can add from either producer
→ All count toward same group total

---

## Technical Details
