# üö® CRITICAL: Run Migration 038 Before Testing

## The Problem We Solved

Your database triggers `on_auth_user_created` and `on_user_membership_created` are **broken**.

They cause `admin.createUser()` to fail with:
```
Database error creating new user
Code: unexpected_failure
```

This prevents ALL invitation signups from working.

## The Solution

**Drop the broken triggers** and handle user creation manually in the API.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Open Supabase SQL Editor

1. Go to: **https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT**
2. Click: **SQL Editor** in left sidebar
3. Click: **New Query**

### 2. Copy Migration 038

Open this file in your codebase:
```
migrations/038_drop_signup_triggers.sql
```

Copy the ENTIRE contents.

### 3. Paste and Execute

1. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
2. Click: **Run** (or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)

### 4. Verify Success

You should see:
```
NOTICE: All signup triggers successfully dropped
```

If you see an error, send me the error message.

### 5. Verify Triggers Are Gone

Run this query to confirm:
```sql
SELECT tgname, tgrelid::regclass 
FROM pg_trigger 
WHERE tgname IN ('on_auth_user_created', 'on_user_membership_created');
```

Should return: **0 rows** (or empty result)

## After Migration is Complete

3. **Create account:**
   - Full Name: "Test User"

## What Changed

### Before Migration 038:
```
admin.createUser()
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí Trigger fires ‚Üí ERROR ‚Üí "Database error creating new user"
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí FAILS before our code even runs
```

### After Migration 038:
```
admin.createUser()
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí No triggers ‚Üí Creates user successfully ‚úì
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí Our code manually creates profile ‚úì
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí Our code manually creates membership with correct level ‚úì
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí Everything works!
```

## Logs You Should See (After Migration)

When testing signup, check Vercel logs for:
```
[INVITE-REDEEM] MANUAL CREATION FLOW - Step 1: Create auth.users
[INVITE-REDEEM] STEP-1 SUCCESS - User created: <uuid>
[INVITE-REDEEM] MANUAL CREATION FLOW - Step 2: Create profile
[INVITE-REDEEM] STEP-2 SUCCESS - Profile created
[INVITE-REDEEM] MANUAL CREATION FLOW - Step 3: Create membership with level: silver
[INVITE-REDEEM] STEP-3 SUCCESS - Membership created
[INVITE-REDEEM] All manual creation steps completed successfully
[INVITE-REDEEM] Awarding IP to inviter: <uuid>
[INVITE-REDEEM] Marking invitation as used
[INVITE-REDEEM] Session available from signUp
```

## If It Still Doesn't Work

Send me:
1. The Vercel logs showing `[INVITE-REDEEM]` entries
2. Specifically which STEP failed (STEP-1, STEP-2, or STEP-3)
3. The error code and message from that step
