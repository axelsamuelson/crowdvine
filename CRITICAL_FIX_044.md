# üö® CRITICAL FIX - Migration 044: Prevent Level Downgrade

## Issue Discovered

**Problem:** Users were being **downgraded** when earning Impact Points.

**Example:**
- User at Bronze level (5 IP)
- Makes order with 8 bottles ‚Üí Earns +1 IP (total: 6 IP)
- System incorrectly downgrades user to Basic
- **This should NEVER happen!**

## Root Cause

The `check_and_upgrade_level()` function uses:
```sql
IF new_level != current_membership.level THEN
  -- Updates level (BOTH upgrades AND downgrades!)
```

This allows **bidirectional** level changes. When IP is earned, the function recalculates level from IP, and if somehow the new level is lower than current level, it downgrades.

## The Fix

Migration 044 updates the function to **only allow upgrades**:

```sql
-- Calculate level order (numeric comparison)
old_level_order := get_level_order(old_level);
new_level_order := get_level_order(new_level);

-- ONLY upgrade if new level is HIGHER
IF new_level_order > old_level_order THEN
  -- Upgrade
ELSE
  -- Keep current level (no downgrade)
  RETURN old_level;
END IF;
```

## How to Apply (URGENT)

### Step 1: Run Migration in Supabase

```bash
# Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor ‚Üí New Query
# Copy and paste: migrations/044_prevent_level_downgrade.sql
# Click Run
```

**Expected output:**
```
‚úÖ Migration 044 completed successfully
‚ö†Ô∏è  IMPORTANT: This fixes critical bug where users were downgraded
```

### Step 2: Fix Affected Users

If any users were incorrectly downgraded, fix them:

```sql
-- Find users who may have been incorrectly downgraded
SELECT 
  u.email,
  m.level,
  m.impact_points,
  get_level_from_points(m.impact_points) as should_be_level
FROM user_memberships m
JOIN auth.users u ON u.id = m.user_id
WHERE get_level_from_points(m.impact_points)::TEXT != m.level::TEXT;

-- Fix each user manually
-- Example: User has 6 IP but is at Basic (should be Bronze)
UPDATE user_memberships
SET 
  level = 'brons',
  invite_quota_monthly = 5,
  level_assigned_at = NOW()
WHERE user_id = 'affected-user-id';
```

### Step 3: Verify Fix

```sql
-- Test the function with a scenario
-- Simulate user at Bronze with 6 IP
DO $$
DECLARE
  test_level membership_level;
BEGIN
  -- User has 6 IP (should stay Bronze, not downgrade)
  test_level := get_level_from_points(6);
  RAISE NOTICE 'Level from 6 IP: %', test_level;
  -- Should be: brons
END $$;
```

## Why This Happened

The issue likely occurred because:

1. User had Bronze level (5-14 IP required)
2. User earned IP (e.g., 5 IP ‚Üí 6 IP)
3. System recalculates level from IP
4. `get_level_from_points(6)` returns 'brons' ‚úÖ
5. But somehow current level was already at a higher value
6. Function allowed downgrade

**Most likely cause:** User was manually set to a higher level by admin, then earned IP, and system "corrected" them back down.

## Prevention

After this fix:
- ‚úÖ Users can ONLY progress upward
- ‚úÖ Even if manually set to high level, earning IP won't downgrade
- ‚úÖ Admins can still manually adjust levels if needed
- ‚úÖ System logs when it would have downgraded (for debugging)

## Long-term Solution

Consider adding to `user_memberships`:
```sql
ALTER TABLE user_memberships 
ADD COLUMN manually_set_level BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;

-- If manually_set_level = TRUE, don't auto-adjust at all
```

## Action Items

1. ‚úÖ Run Migration 044 immediately
2. ‚úÖ Check for affected users in production
3. ‚úÖ Restore correct levels for affected users
4. ‚úÖ Monitor logs for "would have downgraded" notices
5. ‚úÖ Add test case to prevent regression

## Status

- **Severity:** CRITICAL (P0)
- **Impact:** User experience severely degraded
- **Fix Status:** ‚úÖ Ready to deploy
- **Testing:** Required before production
- **Rollback:** Safe (function can be reverted)

**Deploy this fix ASAP!** üö®
